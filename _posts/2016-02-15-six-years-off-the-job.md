Spanish construction supervisor Joaquin Garcia [apparently](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35557725) managed to keep getting paid without turning up to work. For six years!


Garcia was caught out when officials were preparing a special plaque to commemorate his 20 years service.


Garcia has since been fined â‚¬26,920.93, equivalent to one year's earnings. However he strongly denies the allegations made againgst him, insisting he was the victim of 'mobbing'.
